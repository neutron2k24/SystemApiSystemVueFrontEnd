<h1>Student Api System Vue3 Sample</h1>

This Vue3 project demonstrates interaction with the StudentSystemApi project.

Add the project to a new VS2022 solution along with the SystemSystemApi project. 
Set both project to auto start under 'Set Startup Projects' in order to run both in parallel.

The default Api Url for the Vue3 app is https://localhost:7060/api.

If the url is different, you will need to change it using the 'Settings' tab when running the Vue3 app to the correct url.
